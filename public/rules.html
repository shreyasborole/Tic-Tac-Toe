    <h2>Rules for Playing Tic Tac Toe(ButterScotch)</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="para">
        This game is a modified version of Tic Tac Toe. <br> It also is a 2 Player game but instead of each player
        playing with one variable <br> i.e. X and O we have two variables for each player say X1, X2 and O1,O2. Here
        each player has to play in
        the specified order i.e. X1-O1-X2-O2 and X1 again, and so on.<br> Rules to play this game : <br> 1.X1 and O1
        variables have to be placed in an empty spot.<br> 2.X2 can replace O1 only and similarly O2 can replace X1 only.
        <br><br> Consider its
        Player 1's turn to place its X2 variable, in this case he has two options :<br> 1.Place it on an empty
        spot(ideal way of playing).<br> 2.Replace an existing O1's place. <br><br> Winning Conditions :<br> The winning
        conditions are same as that
        of the Vanilla Tic Tac Toe, i.e. you need 3 X's or O's (irrespective of whether it is X1 or X2) in a row, column
        or diagonal. <br><br> Tie Conditions :<br> In our game this condition is a little rare to occur. It can be a
        tie<br> 1.When the board
        has no empty spot and the next player to play is either X1 or O1 (since they have to be placed in an empty
        spot.)<br> 2.When the board has no empty spot and the next player to play is either X2 or O2. In this case the
        player has an advantage since
        he has a chance to overlap an existing appropriate variable to either create a winning condition for itself or
        it'll still be a tie.
